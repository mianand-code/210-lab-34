// Step #3 (wrapping a real-world application around the graph) was generated through an LLM via prompt engineering, as per assignment instructions
// - The real-world application I generated through the LLM was an "airport walking network"
// - The vertices/nodes are different areas within an airport and the edges are walking paths to these areas
// - The weights for each edge are walking times for each path in minutes
